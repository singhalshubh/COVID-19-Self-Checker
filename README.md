# COVID-19-Self-Checker
Created a platform where any self testing for any country can be included.<br>
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/singhalshubh/covid-19-self-checker/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/singhalshubh/covid-19-self-checker)

The platform has two parts - <br>
1. The administrator enters the data of various stages of COVID-19. Make a flowchart of the self checker, and index every node(e.g. the 
node at first depth(node1) has a child node 2, then name it as 012, where insertion of 0 is compulsory, and indexing follows as 1.2, so naming of the node becomes 012.
Enter the name of the node and the corresponding description.<br>
2. For every user, the separate portal is available, where the user can select the correct choice and know what seriousness of COVID-19 he/she is facing.

# Run the repo <br>
1. Download WAMP in Windows and run the 127.0.0.1/index.php?idWeb=1, for administrator.<br>
2. For users, 127.0.0.1/track.php?idWeb=0.

# Application
Using this to create a form for exams can be useful. Google forms have two negative points, reodering using UI(scrolling becomes difficult and if there is a high number of questions then keeping track of the reodered number is difficult, and you cannot delete a response from a form when submitted).

These issues can be resolved by using this system.
